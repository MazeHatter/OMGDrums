Open Music Gallery (OMG) Drum Machine

This is an app for Android. It's a full project, ready to roll. (I suggest you change the namespace.)



===================
Major TODOs:

Allow user to choose and record their samples
OMG Bananas currently integrates with Sketch a Tune. What other apps can it jam with? OMG Guitar and OMG Bass and OMG Synth are works in progress (get OMG Bananas from GooglePlay/AmazonAppstore to see).
?
?
Add more measures? 
3/4, blah blah blah



===================
OMG:

When the user likes a drum beat, this app contributes it to the Open Music Gallery.

The Open Music Gallery is a free and open library of drum beats, melodies, chord changes, the basic elements of music, which can than be combined and recombined for an infinite free and open entertainment.
